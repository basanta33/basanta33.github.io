Hello!

Welcome to my website. My name is Basanta Khakurel.

I am from Kathmandu, Nepal. I moved to Hammond, Louisiana on Fall 2017 for my Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from Southeastern Louisiana University.
I worked with [Dr. April Wright](https://wright-lab.com/) on eastern Pine snakes for my Bachelor's Thesis.
By that time I had already started enjoying working in the Wright Lab so I decided to stay there for my Master's.

For my Master's thesis, I worked on using morphological data to infer phylogenetic tree using Bayesian methods.
I performed experiments on testing the effect of morphological state space in inferring phylogenies.
I also tested a novel model that allowed for different stationary frequencies using posterior predictive approaches.
My thesis can be found [here](/assets/pdf/Khakurel_MasterThesis.pdf).

I am currently working with [Dr. Sebastian Hoehna](https://hoehnalab.github.io/) in LMU-Munich, Germany.
Here, I will be working on more robust models for inferring phylogenetic trees morphological data.
